# PhD-Thesis
This repository contains Sage+jupyter notebooks used in my thesis for computation in permutation invariant matrix models

I recommend using Sage 9.3 together with Jupyter to run the notebooks. Installation instructions can be found at https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html

The notebook `Coset-Cycle-Index-Counting.ipynb` uses the double coset techniques in my thesis (see Appendix D) to compute the number of permutation invariant matrix polynomials (also known as observables) described by directed graphs with fixed local structure. The notebook `Expectation-Values.ipynb` implements the algorithm for computing expectation values of observables in the general Gaussian permutation invariant matrix model. The code is explained in detail in Appendix C of the thesis.
