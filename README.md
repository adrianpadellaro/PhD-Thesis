# PhD-Thesis
This repository contains Sage+jupyter notebooks used in my thesis for computation in permutation invariant matrix models

For running the notebooks I recommend using Sage 9.3 together with Jupyter. Installation instructions can be found at https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html
